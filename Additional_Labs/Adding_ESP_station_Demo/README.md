# OBJECTIVE 
  
  This code should perform the same as the softAP lab while retaining access to the internet. The station mode for ESP wifi connection allows the ESP to connect to a router that designates the ESP an IP address. The same IP address is announced in a ESP-IDE terminal and can be used by any device on the same network as the ESP to access the webserver. Simply replace the SSID and Password strings with the SSID and password for the network the ESP should connect to and the webserver should be available after running.
