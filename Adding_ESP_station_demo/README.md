OBJECTIVE
  
  This code should achieve the same as the softAP lab while maintaining access to the internet. The ESP connects to a router as a station and is designated an IP that is announced through the ESP-IDE terminal. The IP can be used by anyone on the same network as the ESP to access the webserver.
